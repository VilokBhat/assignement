1)Why did you choose the particular algorithm?
 I chose the Random Forest algorithm
 reasons: Random Forest can provide insights into feature importance, Gives more accuracy than other,
 Random Forest is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions.

2)What are the different tuning methods used for the algorithm?
For tuning the Random Forest algorithm,
following methods:
Hyperparameter Tuning,Cross-Validation,Feature Selection

3)Did you consider any other choice of algorithm?Why or why not?
 Yes, I considered other algorithms for classification as well: Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM is another popular algorithm for classification tasks. It aims to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates the classes.
Logistic Regression: While often used for binary classification, logistic regression can also handle multiclass classification. It models the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class.

4)What is the accuracy?
The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.

5)What are the different types of metrics that can be used to evaluate the model?
Precision,Recall,F1-Score,Confusion Matrix etc.,
